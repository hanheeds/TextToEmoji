# Text to Emoji Generation Using BERT ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜³ðŸ˜©

This repository contains code for a text to emoji generation project using BERT, developed by Hanhee Yang and Siwoo Park. The goal of this project is to import and fine-tune a transformer model to generate appropriate emojis based on given text inputs.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/repository_name.git
```

## Usage
To use the text-to-emoji generation model, follow these guidelines:

1. Select the desired notebook file (bert, roberta, distilbert).

2. Change the text inside the cell.

3. Run to emit emojis.

4. Change hyperparameters as desired.

The model will process the input text and generate an appropriate emoji based on the trained model.
